quant analysis 

This package provides a backtesting framework for some quant /technical stock analysis.
The idea is to generate signals with buypoints.. determine the holding period and backtest it on R3000 universe.

The backtest resutls will provide some aggregated summary like average returns, average positive & negative returns, number of trades etc.

Right now the framework supports basic backtesing.

More updates will follow to breakdown the summary by sectors, size etc.
